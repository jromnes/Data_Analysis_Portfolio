Description: The Sentiment Analysis Project utilizes Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications, to create a user-friendly interface for accessing and analyzing sentiment data. The project fetches live news data from external sources using the NewsAPI, performs sentiment analysis using the NLTK library, and visualizes the results in an intuitive dashboard.

Description: Embark on an exploration of data analysis, seamlessly integrating the use of data visualization, extraction, historical analysis, risk assessment, and adeptly navigating the nuanced landscape of a Monte Carlo simulation. This project entails a thorough examination of portfolios, each endowed with a $20,000 investment spanning a 3 year temporal horizon, as well as securing a heavily weighted stock that we have chosen to represent its respective sector. The ensuing qualitative analysis and comparative analysis yield profound insights into the dynamics of an investment performance.

### 3. Predictive Analysis with Machine Learning Models

Description: Predictive analysis plays a crucial role in numerous domains, including finance, healthcare, and marketing. In this project, we explore the intricacies of predictive analysis using machine learning techniques and models. Our aim is to generate and implore a successful machine learning model. We will accomplish this by training multiple models, and choosing the most accurate of the provided outcomes. After testing and training data on the preferred model, provide indicators and signals. Attempt to test and train data, to accurately predict signals. Finally, we are to apply the best model to a predictive analysis of 3 kinds of investors (Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive) and choose the strategy that yields the highest results.
